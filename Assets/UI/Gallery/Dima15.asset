  Title: Lab Rat Dimamante
  Description: This was either Dimamante being experimented on after being captured
    by some shady organization, or Dimamante from a parallel universe where he was
    an unfeeling hired killer. Either way, it's a pretty big divergence from his
    regular self. I like it.
