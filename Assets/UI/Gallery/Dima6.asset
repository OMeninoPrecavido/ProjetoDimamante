  Title: GenerationClash
  Description: Now this is a good one! This is a crossover between what I dubbed
    the three generations of heroes I created back then. They are different groups
    of heroes I would draw in different periods of my life. Here are SuperPorquinho,
    Stickman and Dimamante (his redesigned self).
