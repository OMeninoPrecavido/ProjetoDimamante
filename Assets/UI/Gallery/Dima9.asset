  Title: Oh no...
  Description: "This certainly didn't age well... This character fighting Dimamante
    was another hero I created named Capit\xE3o Prego, which means Captain Nail.
    His power was pretty cool: he could spit nails at people. What isn't so cool
    is what his abbreviated name, displayed on his chest, looks like."
