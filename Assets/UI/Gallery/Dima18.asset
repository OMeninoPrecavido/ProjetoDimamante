  Title: Dimamante's Comic - Part 1
  Description: This is the first page of Dimamante's comic, which me and Murilo decided
    to make back then. It's pretty rough, but I am weirdly proud about it today.
    He wrote the story and I did the drawings. We only ever made two pages, but it
    was fun regardless!
